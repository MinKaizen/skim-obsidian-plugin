# Skim

A lightweight plugin for "skimming" your files (moving the cursor multiple lines at a time).

This plugin adds 2 commands: `skim-up` and `skim-down` which move the cursor up/down 7 lines (can be adjusted in the settings).

No hotkeys are added by default, so you will have to set that up yourself after you install and activate the plugin.

# Installation

Simply install+activate the plugin, then go to your Obsidian settings > hotkeys and search for "skim" to set your hotkeys.

# Why?

If you're like me and you hate using the mouse, skimming will be for you. I wanted a way to scroll through my files without using the mouse.

*Why not use PageDown and PageUp?*

By default, using PageDown and PageUp on your keyboard will scroll the page up and down a whole screen. Personally, I find this to be too disorientating. It hurts my eyes and I always lose track of where I am. I just want to scroll a few lines at a time. Something like 15% of the screen.
